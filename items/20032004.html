<div class="narrative">
  <p>I was originally hired to build and support the Coaches Info Service, a site run by the International Society of Biomechanics in Sports and the University of Edinburgh in order to help make sports biomechanics accessible to professional coaches. I built a new CMS that incorporated precise sports science videos which could be iterated frame by frame as well as played conventionally. </p>
  <p>I was also involved in the promotion of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/education/institutes/spehs/sports-facilities">Center for Aquatic Research and Education</a>, which included a high tech swimming pool that included a battery of cameras and a variable depth floor that could be used for sports research and training.</p>
  <p>I moved on to support the wider Media and Learning Technology Service, where I worked on a variety of tools that supported the campus learning management system. This is where I learned about the EdTech industry, learning management systems, and their underlying technologies and business dynamics. Itâ€™s also where I met Dave Tosh, who I shared a tiny office with. I would go on to co-found my first startup with him.</p>
