<p>Medium is a top 100 website focused on in-depth, quality writing. I joined the team after it acquired Known. I was an integral member of the publications team, building features to support major platforms like The Ringer and ThinkProgress. I built export tools, supported the use of custom domains, and co-founded an Openness Circle that worked on support for standards like Do Not Track. I also facilitated discussions about Medium’s response to the 2016 election.</p>

  <p>It was my first time working at a well-funded startup, or at any organization with over a hundred engineers. It taught me a great deal about team culture in particular: ways to give everyone from engineers and designers to marketers and salespeople the space they needed to be creative and do great work. Medium was particularly thoughtful about creating a more equitable environment, having tried and moved on from <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/">holocracy</a>, and went so far as to open source its hiring process. I’ve carried elements of Medium’s culture into every subsequent job I’ve held.</p>
