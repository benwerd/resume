<h4>
  Director of Investments (San Francisco)

<p>Matter was a venture capital accelerator for media startups backed by partners like PRX, KQED, the New York Times, and the Associated Press. As its west coast Director of Investments, I was responsible for sourcing, investing in, and supporting startups that participated in the accelerator in San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Corey Ford, Matter’s CEO, had previous funded <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a> as part of its third class. When Known was acquired by Medium, I continued to support the Matter community, taking part in interviews and helping community members whenever I could. I’d secretly daydreamed about joining the team and investing directly in startups — so it was incredibly exciting when Corey asked me to do just that. I was happy at Medium, but Matter was particularly special.</p>

<p>I led and executed the west coast investment strategy, ultimately investing in 24 startups across diverse verticals, and helping to support a total portfolio of 73. I led mentorship sessions for portfolio startups that included fundraising, technical decision-making, and team culture. Additionally, I co-taught the product design side of the accelerator itself: a 5-month course on venture design thinking and product strategy for startups and teams drawn from our media partners.</p>

  <p>Because of my varied background, mentorship meetings ran the gamut: it wasn’t uncommon for them to start with fundraising advice and then segue into database schema design or software architecture help, all within the same half hour. Many of the people who were involved in Matter — both as founders and colleagues — remain my friends. Helping to run the Matter program, as well as the community around it, changed my life.</p>
