  <p>Fueled by an interest in the web as a storytelling medium, I decided to undertake a degree in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
  <p>For my final dissertation, I built an accident reporting system that helped investigators figure out the root causes of an incident by adding contributing factors to a weighted, directed graph. I built the system as a collaborative web interface — because the web platform of that time was significantly more limited than today’s, I had to invent a new way to display directed graphs. Today, I could have just used the canvas element or any number of libraries.</p>
  <p>I also studied Artificial Intelligence, and took a course in Forensic Medicine (because I thought it would be useful for telling certain kinds of stories). In general, I was frustrated by how purely mathematical the course was — those topics were important, but to me computers were an inherently <em>human</em> medium. I craved instruction about what I’d later call human-centered design and the impact of networked computing on society. Absolutely none of that was present, and it was sometimes hard to stay motivated.</p>
  <p>I took a year out between my third and fourth years, wherein I did some work for Daily Information and continued to learn web development.</p>
