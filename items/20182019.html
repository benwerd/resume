<p>Unlock is an open source startup building a protocol for membership on the open web. I was its first employee, helping to establish the engineering team and guide its initial strategy.</p>
<div class="narrative">
  <p>I’d known <a href="https://www.ouvre-boite.com/about">Julien Genestoux</a>, Unlock’s founder, for years: we traveled in the same open web circles. We’d discussed our previous projects, Known and Superfeedr, with each other, and I’d been surprised when I started at Medium and discovered that Superfeedr had also been acquired. He had subsequently decided that the open web was missing a protocol for membership, and needed a partner on the product side. Matter’s media partners, facing a more uncertain future for journalism, had consolidated their funding. I was, therefore, free to join.</p>
  <p>While I was (and remain) a blockchain skeptic, I cared deeply about Unlock’s mission to help every independent creative sustain themselves on the web. Targeted advertising encouraged a surveillance society, and consolidated wealth among a small number of platforms. An open protocol had the potential to empower everyone to control their creative destinies. Julien is inspiring, and his energy is infectious; I thought (and think) that he was more likely than most people to succeed in this mission.</p>

<p>As well as establishing a cross-disciplinary, open source development team, I actively worked on the core Node and React / Redux codebase, including some integration with the Ethereum blockchain. </p>

  <p>In 2019, my mother faced serious health complications from her lung transplant, and I spent eleven weeks at her side in the hospital. Because of my need to attend to her and stay in California rather than relocate to New York, I left Unlock.</p>
