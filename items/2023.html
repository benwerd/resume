  Interim Tech Lead (2023)<br>

<p>ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning non-profit newsroom founded to expose abuses of power and betrayals of the public trust by government, business, and other institutions. I joined the team to guide the engineering and IT teams after a staff transition, initially as an interim contract worker and then as the full-time Senior Director of Technology.</p>

  <p>In a world where it’s easy to feel powerless, ProPublica makes people feel like someone is fighting in their corner. That mission is important to me, and from stories about Supreme Court corruption to revelations about Peter Thiel’s oversized Roth savings plan, it’s making a real impact.</p>

<p>I established team policies like code review and spearheaded new hiring initiatives with more equitable hiring standards. I have co-organized staff summits, providing design thinking training, and facilitated discussions with external engineering and product leaders. I worked on a transition to cloud-based, zero-trust enterprise technology, including Google Workspace and Okta. Additionally, I am a hands-on individual contributor across multiple projects, writing code and convening stakeholders as necessary. Where appropriate, I provide technical assistance to journalists who are actively reporting on stories.</p>
