<h4>
  Webmaster
</h4>
<p>The Saïd Business School was in need of a new website that could serve as a recruiting tool, as well as a resource for its students, faculty, and staff. I joined the IT team as its Webmaster.</p>
<p>I integrated a new design by Loewy into Microsoft Content Management Server, as well as a set of interactive templates and application code in C#. I served as a resource to the whole IT team, collaborated with academics and the events team, built intranet tools, and led presentations on web technologies.</p>

  <p>In particular, it became clear to the MBA students that I knew a lot about the web and startups, and I began to serve as an unofficial resource to them. I also attended Silicon Valley Comes to Oxford seminars with leading names in the tech industry, like Craig Newmark, Marc Benioff, Ev Williams, and Biz Stone (the latter of whom joined my startup as an advisor).</p>
