  Head of Engineering

<p>ForUsAll aims to help more people save for retirement. I was the Head of Engineering, reporting to the CEO, and effectively acted as the CTO for the organization.</p>
<div class="narrative">
  <p>My friend Phil Balliet, who had previous been a member of a Matter-supported founding team, was the Head of Design. He let me know that ForUsAll was looking for a new technical leader. While fintech is not my core interest, I was drawn by ForUsAll’s mission to make retirement savings accessible to people on lower incomes. Although I believe a real social safety net is necessary, in a world where that doesn’t exist, companies like ForUsAll have the potential to make a difference.</p>

<p>I built and led a 22-person engineering team, and oversaw all technology decisions. This included revamping the hiring process for engineers to become more open and equitable. I also shepherded the company through a SOC 2 security audit process, established digital security practices like an encrypted VPN, and helped to transition the company to remote working in a post-Covid environment.</p>
<p>ForUsAll pivoted to allow savers to include alternative investments in their retirement portfolio. I assisted in this process, helping to scope and design integrations with third-party trading platforms.</p>

  <p>Over the three years I was there, I learned a great deal about operating in a well-regulated industry, as well as implementing security practices across an enterprise organization. I’m particularly grateful for ForUsAll’s support when my mother died. </p>
