  Curverider (2006-2009)
</h3>
<h4>
  Co-Founder, Chief Technology Officer
</h4>
<p>Curverider was the startup founded to provide commercial services for Elgg. I served as CTO, while Dave Tosh was CEO. In reality, we both led business operations and collaborated technically.</p>
<p class="narrative">Working on Elgg full-time as part of Curverider taught me about software architecture; engineering leadership; startup business strategy; sales; marketing; community management; fundraising and much more.</p>
<p>We bootstrapped the startup to profitability: our first client was MIT, with whom we worked on the first OpenCourseWare platform. We subsequently worked with the University of Brighton to launch the worldâ€™s first social network to roll out campus-wide at a university. We received extensive coverage in outlets like the Guardian, ZDNet, and TechCrunch, and received a Best in Open Source Software award from InfoWorld.</p>
<p>We launched a hosted social networking platform in direct competition with Ning, and created a semi-distributed social network called Explode that attracted the attention of press and investors. The latter led to us raising investment and hiring a team.</p>
<p class="narrative">Ultimately, the working relationship between co-founders became toxic. We had strong differences of opinion about how a company should be run and which values were important. I chose to leave in early 2009.</p>
<p>Curverider was ultimately acquired by Thematic Networks in 2010.</p>
