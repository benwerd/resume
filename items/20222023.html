<h4>
  Chief Technology Officer

<p>The 19th is a non-profit newsroom focusing on gender, politics, and policy. I was its first CTO and pioneered the technology team’s role within the newsroom.</p>

  <p>This was one of those jobs where five or six people sent me the description and said, “this sounds like you.” It did, and I was very excited by the prospect of returning to work alongside journalism — particularly at a time when democracy seemed to be at a critical juncture. Years later, when I was asked what I did in this moment in history, I didn’t want to have to reply that I was sat on the sidelines. The 19th’s inclusive mission spoke directly to my worries.</p>

<p>I led the hiring and mentorship of engineers, cultivated an open, transparent team culture, and actively contributed to the core codebase. I steered a transition to WordPress VIP as the core CMS platform, and developed an equity-focused process for making technology decisions overall. I was also an integral member of the senior leadership team, helping to shape organizational strategy overall.</p>
<div class="narrative">
  <p>The 19th has the most intentional, thoughtful culture of any organization I’ve ever worked in. I was delighted to contribute to it, but more than that, I was excited to learn. Like every organization, there was room for growth and improvement, and the conversations around change were always open and participative.</p>
