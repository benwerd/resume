<p>Known is an open source publishing platform that powers mobile-first communities. I co-founded the startup and both wrote and conceived of the first versions of the software.</p>
<div class="narrative">
  <p>I started writing the platform that would become Known as my mother recovered from a double-lung transplant. When it became clear that she had a terminal illness, I moved to the US to be closer to her. The transplant prolonged her life, but she remarked that there was no community platform where she felt safe discussing her experiences. Known was originally built in 2013 to be a self-hosted, private community platform for her. It also helped me answer the question: if I’d built Elgg in a world with iPhones and ubiquitous broadband, what would it have looked like?</p>
  <p>I began to collaborate with Erin Richey on its design. She suggested that we turn it into a startup and pitch it to <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/startups-pitch-projects-matter-three-demo-day/">Matter</a>, an accelerator for media startups. We were accepted and became part of the third cohort. We also shifted its focus from community platforms to becoming an <a href="https://indieweb.org">indieweb</a> publishing platform that allowed people to own their own social spaces on the web.</p>

<p>I built an open open source platform and community, and secured funding from Matter Ventures. Customers for our platform included KQED, Davidson College, and Harvard University; KQED received a NAMLE media literacy award for the site we built together.</p>
<div class="narrative">
  <p>The open source platform <a href="https://github.com/idno/known">continues to exist today</a>, but the startup was acquired by <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>, which allowed me to repay Matter’s investment.</p>
