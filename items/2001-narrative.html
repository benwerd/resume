<p>Annoyed by the personality tests that were beginning to swamp the early web — <em>which Care Bear are you?</em> — I set out to write an acerbic parody. I put <em>Which Evil Criminal Are You?</em> out on the web on a Friday night, and by Sunday morning it had been taken over 100,000 times — an incredible number for a tiny personal whim published on the 2001-era web.</p>
<p>I turned that personality test into a meme and humor site that often received over a million pageviews a day. Its memes intentionally made fun of politicians and conservative institutions, and it received coverage in media around the world.</p>
<p>The site taught me about virality, meme culture, and how to build for social media. When we added a forum that attracted a community of teenagers, many of whom were in vulnerable situations, it also taught me about moderation and community standards. Some of the work we did influenced later, more profitable sites like Buzzfeed. The revenue I made from Rum &amp; Monkey made projects like Elgg possible. I wrote about the experience <a href="https://words.werd.io/we-are-the-monkeys-of-rum-70f81d4a02df">in a Medium piece years later</a>.</p>
<p>Eventually, as it became less of a focus for me, the site began to fade away. It was eventually sold to a social media advertising firm.</p>
