<p>
  Elgg was one of the first white label social networking platforms. I co-founded and developed the platform, built a thriving open source community, and worked on everything from sales and marketing to cultivating deep partnerships with institutions around the world. Elgg powered networks for governments (Australia, Netherlands, Canada), NGOs like Oxfam, and Fortune 500 companies like Hill & Knowlton. It was translated into over 80 languages and attracted hundreds of active contributors.

  <p>Dave Tosh and I shared a tiny office at the Moray House School of Education. He was studying for a PhD in e-learning; I was working as an EdTech developer. We both agreed that existing learning technology platforms didn’t actually help anyone learn — and because I’d been blogging since 1998 and building web systems since 1995, I knew that people <em>were</em> learning from each other all over the web.</p>
  <p>We wrote a paper that described how reflective blogging could form the foundation of a more useful learning technology platform, which was widely read. Someone fatefully commented: “it’s one thing to write about it; it’s another thing to build it”. So we did.</p>
  <p>Dave and I both built prototypes. I built mine in PHP and put it on a domain name I used for my email, which related to Elgg, the town in Switzerland my Dad’s family is from. Dave wrote one in ColdFusion. In the end, we developed mine further, and tried to give it to the university. When they declined to pick it up (letting us know in strong terms that social platforms had no place in education), I quit my job and started to develop it full-time on my own.</p>

<p>I established the core codebase and both wrote and designed the first versions of the software. With Dave Tosh, I did extensive user research, intentionally designing the software to directly meet user needs in a human-centered way. I later led the expanded technology team and turned the open source platform into a startup, guiding the project from an education-focused application to a broader social networking platform.</p>
<p>I presented at venues including Stanford University, Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, the University of Southern Denmark, the University of Barcelona, the ALT-C educational technology conference, the University of Cambridge, and events across Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The platform continues to exist today <a href="https://github.com/elgg/elgg">as an open source project</a>, with a new core team.</p>
