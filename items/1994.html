  <p>Daily Information is an information sheet in my hometown of Oxford, England that has been published since the 1960s. Its proprietor, <a href="https://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/dailyinfo/johnobituary.htm">John Rose</a>, was a local legend.</p>
  <p>He originally hired me — as an after-school job — to run the Bulletin Board System. Anyone in Oxford could dial in and read the entertainment listings or the classified ads.</p>
  <p>In 1995, I learned HTML in order to create Daily Information’s first website, which was one of the first – possibly <em>the</em> first – classified ads websites, pre-dating even Craigslist. Over the years to come, I would revamp the website many times, and continue to offer support to the team as a consultant. I last worked with them in 2009.</p>
