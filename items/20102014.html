  <p>I met the founders of Latakoo at a talk I gave at the Kennedy School of Government in 2009. Seeing some emerging issues with the journalism industry in America, and in particular in their home state of Texas, they were hoping to create a new model for local journalism. I agreed to help them.</p>
  <p>On the way, we discovered that TV news crews were being sent out into the field with digital HD cameras, but had no efficient way to get that footage back to the newsroom. They were often using 3G cards to FTP uncompressed footage, which took many hours. We realized we could use a combination of existing compression techniques and a simple user experience in order to reduce the transmission time to minutes. It worked — and was faster than solutions that were orders of magnitude more expensive. They named the product Latakoo and began to sell it to local newsrooms around the country.</p>

<p>Latakoo allows TV journalists to swiftly transfer videos back to their newsrooms, where it arrives in the format of the newsroom’s choice, via any internet connection. Its customers include NBC News, Nexstar Media Group, and Spectrum News.</p>
<p>I was its first employee and helped the startup define and build its core product. I also conceived of its co-located enterprise product, Latakoo Hub, which has helped bring the startup to profitability. While I was on the team, Latakoo’s software facilitated news video transfers from locations including the Sochi Olympics, Syria, Mount Everest, and Air Force One.</p>
<p>I’m the co-author of two patents that were granted for this work, and remain a member of the Latakoo Board of Directors.</p>
