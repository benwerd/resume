<h4>Developer / Designer</h4>
<p>My mother taught me to program BASIC on an 8-bit Atari XE. I was enthralled by text adventures in particular: interactive stories with a strong narrative flow. As a child I wrote my own, which were closer to <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> branching stories than real Infocom-style text adventures, which had a parser.</p>
<p>In my early teens, I started writing more graphically-focused MS-DOS games in Pascal. I began to release them as shareware: a form of software releasing that was popular before open source became mainstream, where a small version of your software was freely distributed, and the more complete product could be bought. My games found their way onto magazine cover CDs, anthologies, and Bulletin Board Systems around the world.</p>
<p>I also started Spire Magazine, a hypertext “e-zine” that included tech news and games reviews. (I received free review copies, which I gave to my friends in exchange for reviews; I was in it for the magazine itself.) I interviewed celebrities like Roger Ebert and Nicholas Negroponte over email. The magazine became an experimental space to play with the hypertext medium (using Windows Help files), which eventually informed the work I built on the web.</p>
